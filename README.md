#apcs2 final project... i guess
UPDATE, JUNE 8: We haven't been updating this README because our commit logging is documented in our commit messages. Please see those for a detailed map of update stages. 

June 8
-DANIEL: Added new movement controls for enemies. Squares now properly detect their distance from the goal with a breadth-first search. However, placing a tower in the immediate path of an enemy will not prevent the enemy from going through the tower's square, even though it SHOULD be blocked off. I'll ask about it in class tomorrow, but I can't see a possible fix.
June 9-10:
-DANIEL: Attempted to implement projectiles. There is a single commit for the entire release, as I tried to work on them for days without satisfactory success. See my commit message in my branch to see the progress that I made. As I said there, I will likely scrap this, because the loops cause too much lag.
