UPDATE, JUNE 8: We haven't been updating this README because our commit logging is documented in our commit messages. Please see those for a detailed map of update stages. 

June 8
-DANIEL: Added new movement controls for enemies. Squares now properly detect their distance from the goal with a breadth-first search. However, placing a tower in the immediate path of an enemy will not prevent the enemy from going through the tower's square, even though it SHOULD be blocked off. I'll ask about it in class tomorrow, but I can't see a possible fix.
June 9-10:
-DANIEL: Attempted to implement projectiles. There is a single commit for the entire release, as I tried to work on them for days without satisfactory success. See my commit message in my branch to see the progress that I made. As I said there, I will likely scrap this, because the loops cause too much lag.

June 12: 
-STEVEN: *Disclaimer* I did not commit and push over the weekend for fear that there would be frequent major merge conflicts that would result in a lot of unnecessary work. Thus, even though I worked over the course of the entire weekend, I only committed once, at 1 AM on June 12. The work I have done has included created a SideBar that can allow a player to see the amount of money and lives left, as well as their score and the level. Additionally, towers can be created by clicking on the small bluish square in the sidebar, and then placed upon clicking the mouse on the board. Some work was also done on upgrades; however, they do not work at all. Additionally, I tried to put together my code and the code Daniel wrote on projectiles.
