June 8
-DANIEL: Added new movement controls for enemies. Squares now properly detect their distance from the goal with a breadth-first search. However, placing a tower in the immediate path of an enemy will not prevent the enemy from going through the tower's square, even though it SHOULD be blocked off. I'll ask about it in class tomorrow, but I can't see a possible fix.
